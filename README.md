# group checker,
or codename `valley` is a group account checker, that works for **funds** and **pending**. might be useful for selling roblox groups with funds, idk. 🤷‍♂️

this checker offers user-friendly ui, that will make experience with this software easier than ever.

* quick note!
    * now, you can receive support at [this server](https://discord.gg/rFfJAtN22s). any questions, suggestions and etc will be accepted only here.

## how do i even start using it?
at first, lets start with programms required to even use this group checker.

1. [**python**](https://python.org/downloads/) *(recommended to use version **3.12.2**, because autoclaimer was written on it)*

and.. thats it. seriously! you only need python. after you install everything and extract everything required, open `cmd` and run commmand `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## how do i even use this?
on start up, you have **7** choices. those are:
1. exit > `This feature exists only if you are lazy to close cmd, or press CTRL+D`
basically, exits programm for you.

2. add cookie > `Add Roblox Cookie to Group scanner. Required to setup in order to have everything work.`
adding cookie to checker, required to run before every action *(except for exit and add cookie)*

3. create full scan > `Full scan, including check for Pending and Funds.`
runs scan for both pending and funds. might be slower than pending/funds scan, since **requires 2 requests/group**.

4. create scan for pending > `Checks only for pending. Way faster, than full scan.`
same as `create full scan`, but only checks pending. **faster, than full scan.**

4. create scan for funds > `Checks only for funds. Way faster, than full scan.`
same as `create full scan`, but only checks funds. **faster, than full scan.**

5. mass funds visibility > `Makes all owned group funds visible for everyone.`
enables visiblity of funds for everyone. i don't know why you would need it, it was suggestion to add it.

6. mass group shout changer > ` Changes shouts of all owned groups to setted one.`
automaticly change shout to whatever you type. i'm __not__ responsible for whatever your going to receive for your stupid actions.
